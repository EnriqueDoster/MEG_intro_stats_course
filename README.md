### Summary
These lessons are designed to introduce researchers to the R programming language for statistical analysis of metagenomic sequencing data. While we are primarily developing these training resources for the Microbial Ecology Group (MEG), we would love to get your input on improvements to any component so that we can one day provide this as a useful public resource. As the lessons are meant to be an informal collection of resources and tutorials, we have have liberally used parts and pieces of other online lessons and tailored it for our purposes. We attempt to give credit when possible by linking the original source and we are happy to hear recommendations for other resources to include.

The focus of lesson 1 is to help students install R on their computer, install the necessary R packages, and start playing around with R's functionality. In Lesson 2, students will learn how to calculate and plot summary statistics, including alpha-diversity indices to summarize the microbiome and resistome. In Lesson 3, we'll dive into count normalization using cumulative sum scaling (CSS), ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling, differential abundance testing with a zero-inflated Gaussian (ZIG) model, and advanced plotting using ggplot2.

This will be the first time that we attempt going through this lesson with a group of students, so please participate in the slack group and ask any questions you have!
* We'll organize a group to all take the same lesson together and **we'll have a virtual meeting once per week for 30 minutes** to go over each of the steps in that lesson. The majority of the work will be self-directed and on your own time, but we encourage you to work in groups and participate in asking questions in the slack group. If you don't have any questions and find this all extremely easy, please help others with their questions and help us improve our lessons.
  * There is 1 "deliverable" per step. Some steps require something be sent to "meglab.metagenomics@gmail.com" or will have a link to a corresponding set of questions.

### Techie time
We wholeheartedly encourage students to independently troubleshoot the majority of problems they might encounter by:
* googling it (or using another search engine)
* getting help from other students by using our slackgroup channel #2020-stats-tutorial-group
* searching bioinformatic forums such as (stackoverflow.com, biostars.org, seqanswers.com, etc.)

In addition, we will have "techie time" every Monday at 12pm-2pm MST on Slack to help address any ongoing issues.


### Learning objectives:
Upon completion of these lessons, students will:
* have their computer set up with the R and RStudio software
* know how to read-in count matrices from bioinformatic analysis of sequence data
* be able to explore and summarize bioinformatic results using
  * diversity indices and box plots
  * ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
  * heatmaps
* be familiar with common statistical techiniques such as:
  * Wilcoxon test
  * Generalized linear models
  * Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)
  * Differential abundance testing using a zero-inflated Gaussian (ZIG) model
