# Introduction to statistical analysis of metagenomic sequencing data
## Course syllabus
Start Date: May 11, 2020

Email: meglab.metagenomics@gmail.com

Slack group: microbialecol-1s68204.slack.com

### Summary
These lessons are designed to introduce researchers to the R statistical language for statistical analysis of microbiome and resistome results. The focus of lesson 1 is to help students install R on their computer, install the necessary R packages, and start playing around with R's functionality. In Lesson 2, students will learn how to calculate and plot summary statistics, including alpha-diversity indices to summarize the microbiome and resistome. In Lesson 3, we'll dive into count normalization using cumulative sum scaling (CSS), ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling, differential abundance testing with a zero-inflated Gaussian (ZIG) model, and advanced plotting using ggplot2.

While we are primarily developing these training resources for the Microbial Ecology Group, we would love to get your input on improvements to any components so that we can one day provide this as a public resource. This will be the first time that we attempt going through this lesson with a group of students, so please participate in the slack group and ask any questions you have!
* We'll organize a group to all take the same lesson together and we'll have a virtual meeting once per week for 30 minutes to go over each of the steps in that lesson. The majority of the work will be self-directed and on your own time, but we encourage you to work in groups and participate in asking questions in the slack group. If you don't have any questions and find this all extremely easy, please help others with their questions and help us improve our tutorial.
  * There is 1 "deliverable" per step. Some steps require something be sent to "meglab.metagenomics@gmail.com" or will have a link to a corresponding set of questions.


### Learning objectives:
Upon completion of these lessons, students will:
* have their computer set up with the R and RStudio software
* know how to read-in count matrices from bioinformatic analysis of sequence data
* be able to explore and summarize bioinformatic results using
  * diversity indices and box plots
  * ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
  * heatmaps
* be familiar with common statistical techiniques such as:
  * Wilcoxon test
  * Generalized linear models
  * Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)
  * Differential abundance testing using a zero-inflated Gaussian (ZIG) model

### Resources:
* [Installing R](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)
* [YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)
  * This is a free online book that goes over many useful topics in a quirky, but fun way! Follow along with our simplified R scripts in Lesson 1 and reference this book if you have any other questions.
* [R programming coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
  * This free coursera course goes in-depth with all of the functionality of R. It combines videos with example R scripts for you to follow along with. We recommend this course after you have been playing around with R a bit and want to learn more about the details into how R works.
* [Introduction to R workshop](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2018-introduction-to-R/)
* [GUide to STatistical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME)](https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame)

# Deliverables:
Lesson 1 deliverables
* For Step 1 and 2, students must send a screenshot of their "sessionInfo()" to ensure that R and R studio are installed in addition to the necessary R packages, respectively.
* Step 3 - After familiarizing themselves with some basic R functionality, students will submit a short quiz.
* Step 4 - Given a count matrix file, taxonomy file, and sample metadata file, students must read-in all data to R and provide:
  * The number of rows and columns for each file
  * A short description of what kind of samples are being analyzed
  * A short description of what the taxonomy contains and how it relates to the count table.

Lesson 2 deliverables
* TBD

Lesson 3 deliverables
* TBD
