### Summary
These lessons are designed to introduce researchers to the R programming language for statistical analysis of metagenomic sequencing data. While we are primarily developing these training resources for the Microbial Ecology Group (MEG), we would love to get your input on improvements to any component so that we can one day provide this as a useful public resource. As the lessons are meant to be an informal collection of resources and tutorials, we have have liberally used parts and pieces of other online lessons and tailored it for our purposes. We attempt to give credit when possible by linking the original source and we are happy to hear recommendations for other resources to include.

The focus of lesson 1 is to help students install R on their computer, install the necessary R packages, and start playing around with R's functionality. In Lesson 2, students will learn how to calculate and plot summary statistics, including alpha-diversity indices to summarize the microbiome and resistome. In Lesson 3, we'll dive into count normalization using cumulative sum scaling (CSS), ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling, differential abundance testing with a zero-inflated Gaussian (ZIG) model, and advanced plotting using ggplot2.

This will be the first time that we attempt going through this lesson with a group of students, so please participate in the slack group and ask any questions you have!
* We'll organize a group to all take the same lesson together and **we'll have a virtual meeting once per week for 30 minutes** to go over each of the steps in that lesson. The majority of the work will be self-directed and on your own time, but we encourage you to work in groups and participate in asking questions in the slack group. If you don't have any questions and find this all extremely easy, please help others with their questions and help us improve our lessons.
  * There is 1 "deliverable" per step. Some steps require something be sent to "meglab.metagenomics@gmail.com" or will have a link to a corresponding set of questions.

### Techie time
We wholeheartedly encourage students to independently troubleshoot the majority of problems they might encounter by:
* googling it (or using another search engine)
* getting help from other students by using our slackgroup channel #2020-stats-tutorial-group 
* searching bioinformatic forums such as (stackoverflow.com, biostars.org, seqanswers.com, etc.)

In addition, we will have "techie time" every Thursday at 12pm MST on Slack to help address any ongoing issues.


### Learning objectives:
Upon completion of these lessons, students will:
* have their computer set up with the R and RStudio software
* know how to read-in count matrices from bioinformatic analysis of sequence data
* be able to explore and summarize bioinformatic results using
  * diversity indices and box plots
  * ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
  * heatmaps
* be familiar with common statistical techiniques such as:
  * Wilcoxon test
  * Generalized linear models
  * Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)
  * Differential abundance testing using a zero-inflated Gaussian (ZIG) model

### Resources:
MEG resources

R programming
* [RStudio cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
  * This website has tons of helpful cheatsheets for various R packages and analyses methods. Also includes cheatsheets in other languages.
* [YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)
  * This is a free online book that goes over many useful topics in a quirky, but fun way! Follow along with our simplified R scripts in Lesson 1 and reference this book if you have any other questions.
* [R programming coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
  * This free coursera course goes in-depth with all of the functionality of R. It combines videos with example R scripts for you to follow along with. We recommend this course after you have been playing around with R a bit and want to learn more about the details into how R works.
* [Introduction to R workshop](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2018-introduction-to-R/)
  * We haven't personally tried this workshop, but they have a combination of videos, slides, and R code for various topics.

Command-line 
* [Explain shell](https://explainshell.com/)
  * cool website that explains bash commands piece by piece


Statistics
* [GUide to STatistical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME)](https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame)
* [LHS 610: Exploratory Data Analysis for Health](https://kdpsingh.lab.medicine.umich.edu/lhs-610)
  * We haven't personaly tried this course, but they provide great videos and code examples for learning how to explore data using R.

* For Step 1 and 2, students must send a screenshot of their "sessionInfo()" to ensure that R and R studio are installed in addition to the necessary R packages, respectively.
* Step 3 - After familiarizing themselves with some basic R functionality, students will submit a short quiz.
* Step 4 - Given a count matrix file, taxonomy file, and sample metadata file, students must read-in all data to R and provide:
  * The number of rows and columns for each file
  * A short description of what kind of samples are being analyzed
  * A short description of what the taxonomy contains and how it relates to the count table.
