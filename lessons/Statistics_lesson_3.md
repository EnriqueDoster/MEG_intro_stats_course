# Lesson 3 - "Advanced statistical analyses and plotting"

## Learning objectives
* normalize count matrices to account for differences in sequence depth
* visualize multivariate data with ordination and statistically compare sample clustering
* compare differential abundance for individual taxa using a Zero-inflated Gaussian model
* be able to run MEG's R GUI code to automate data processing and the creation of exploratory figures
* learn to make ordination plots, heatmaps, and volcano plots

## Task overview:
We will break up this lesson into 5 steps. We'll meet once a week to discuss each step and students will independently work on the "task" and associated "deliverable" that must be sent to meglab.metagenomics@gmail.com.
* [Step 1](#step-1---count-normalization): Count normalization
* [Step 2](#step-2---ordination-with-non---metric-multidimensional-scaling-and-statistical-comparisons): Ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling and statistical comparisons
* [Step 3](#step-3---differential-abundance-testing-with-a-zero---inflated gaussian-model): Differential abundance testing with a Zero-inflated Gaussian model
* [Step 4](#step-4---learn-to-run-meg-r-gui-code-for-exploratory-figures): Learn to run MEG R GUI code for exploratory figures
* [Step 5](#step-5---advanced-plotting): Advanced plotting (heatmaps, volcano plots, ordination)
