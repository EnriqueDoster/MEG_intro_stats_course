# Like phyloseq, metagenomeSeq has it's own functions for accessing their data.
# Here, we need to use MRcounts() and re-make the phyloseq object with the normalized counts

# Use the new counts and merge with components from our original phyloseq object.
CSS_normalized_qiime.ps <- merge_phyloseq(otu_table(CSS_microbiome_counts, taxa_are_rows = TRUE),sample_data(microbiome.ps),tax_table(microbiome.ps), phy_tree(microbiome.ps))

otu_table(CSS_normalized_phylum_qiime.ps) <- round(otu_table(CSS_normalized_phylum_qiime.ps))

# As we've seen in the previous scripts, you would now use these normalized counts for most subsequent analysis
# In this script, we'll need to convert our phylum counts back to an MRexperiment (metagenomeSeq package)
# to use the zero-inflated Gaussian model (ZIG) for differential abundance testing.

# We'll use the package below which provides useful functions for differential abundance testing

# We can use the testDA() function to try out multiple differential abundance tests.
# Check out this website for all other options: https://labs.cd2h.org/gitforager/repository/repository.jsp?id=95257642

# Here, lets just clean up our data and remove any features that aren't in at least 1 sample.

### Using metagenomeSeq
##
#

# We debated showing you this next code because it adds a lot of other functions you aren't 
# familiar with, but we wanted to make sure you had a template to use in the future.

# Above, we used the "testDA" library because it's functions wraps a bunch of other useful
# functions and allows us to compare the results from different tests.

# We then used the "DA.zig()" function to create the ZIG model, but this is also just a "wrapper"
# for the functions in metagenomeSeq and can limit your control over the model. 

# Below we'll show you the native functions used for creating a ZIG model.

# We can use metagenomeSeq's function aggTax to aggregate counts as in phyloseq
phylum_microbiome.metaseq <- aggTax(microbiome.metaseq, lvl = "phylum")

# metagenomeSeq also has functions for filtering data
filtered_phylum_microbiome.metaseq <- filterData(phylum_microbiome.metaseq, present = 3)

# Make the "zero" model with library size of the raw data
zero_mod <- model.matrix(~0+log(libSize(microbiome.metaseq)))
# Make model with "Group" variable
Group <- pData(phylum_microbiome.metaseq)$Group
design_group = model.matrix(~0 + Group)

zig_model <- fitZig(obj= filtered_phylum_microbiome.metaseq, mod = design_group, zeroMod=zero_mod, useCSSoffset = FALSE)

# Use Ebayes to adjust model fit
ebayes_zig_model <- eBayes(zig_model$fit)
ebayes_zig_model

zigFit_Group = zig_model$fit
finalMod_Group = zig_model$fit$design
contrast_Group = makeContrasts(GroupControl-GroupTreatment, levels=finalMod_Group)
zigFit_contrasts = contrasts.fit(zigFit_Group, contrast_Group)
EB_zigFit_contrasts = eBayes(zigFit_contrasts)

# make table of results, you can output these results with "write.csv()"
# Explore this table for the results.
table_EB_zigFit_contrasts <- topTable(EB_zigFit_contrasts, coef=1, adjust.method="BH",number = 1000)


#
## Make simple volcano plots of ZIG results
#
# We'll go over other better ways to plot your ZIG results in Lesson 3, step 5.

# Create sizes for the points on the plot based on "AveExpr"
radius_phylum_node <- sqrt(table_EB_zigFit_contrasts$AveExpr/pi)
# Create the volcano plot, circle size by AveExpr and color by p-value
sign.genes=which(table_EB_zigFit_contrasts$adj.P.Val<0.05)

                            circles = radius_phylum_node,inches=0.1, fg="black",
                            bg=ifelse(table_EB_zigFit_contrasts$adj.P.Val<.06,"red","gray"),
